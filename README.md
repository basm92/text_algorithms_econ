1. Preprocessing class

## Content outline


### Notebook 1: Simple Dictionary Example
- Show how a simple dictionary of positive and negative words can track the movement of the economy
- Very simple preprocessing using standard packages
- [Dictionary example taken from](https://github.com/sekhansen/course_unstructured_data/blob/main/notebooks/preprocessing_notebook.ipynb) 
- Data: Bank of England MPC Minutes
- Highlight the potential for more complete processing

### Notebook 2: Preprocessing
- [Building on this notebook](https://github.com/sekhansen/mres_methods_course/blob/main/notebooks/preprocessing_notebook.ipynb)
- Update preprocessing class
- Show comparison with "simple" preprocessing from Notebook 1
- Data: Bank of England MPC Minutes
- End up producing clean tokens as well as doc-term frequency matrix

### Notebook 2 Appendix: Complex processing
- [Mainly building on this notebook](https://github.com/yabramuvdi/imperial-workshop/blob/master/notebooks/preprocessing_notebook.ipynb)
- Data: 10K 2019 sentences

### Notebook 3: 
- Introduce 10K data (a row is a company in 2019)
- Simple example of how a vector-representation of documents is meaningful: e.g. 2 terms and different companies on a plane
- Cosine similarity on the document-term matrix
- Motivation to jump to dimensionality reduction techniques
- Introduce LSA, d2v, NMF, lda, tfidf
