### Notebook 1: Simple dictionary examples with regular expressions
- **Summary**: This notebook illustrates how a simple count of negative and positive terms can generate a sentiment index that correlates with GDP growth.
- **Data**: Minutes from the Monetary Policy Committee at the Bank of England.

### Notebook 2: Preprocessing and document-term matrix creation
- **Summary**: This notebook illustrates how to apply multiple preprocessing steps to clean text data and build a document-term matrix.
- **Data**: Minutes from the Monetary Policy Committee at the Bank of England.

### Notebook 3: Dimensionality reduction with LDA
- **Summary**: This notebook illustrates how to reduce the dimension of the document-term matrix with one particular method; Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).
- **Data**: USA State of the Union Addresses and Minutes from the Monetary Policy Committee at the Bank of England.

### Notebook 4: Word2Vec
- **Summary**: This notebook illustrates how to estimate word embeddings using the word2vec algorithm.
- **Data**: Bank of England Inflation Reports and Minutes from the Monetary Policy Committee at the Bank of England.

### Notebook 5: Large language models for feature generation
